**Questions asked**

1.	What is the most used currency?
2.	Who are our top customers?
3.	What revenue was generated on the 7th of January, 2017
4.	What channel of distribution generates the most profit
5.	What is the total unit cost of each product.

**Answers and Recommendations**
1.	From the pivot table representations, SQL queries, powerbi visuals we discover that the new Zealand dollar (NZD) is the most used currency in terms of the number of items bought from the workshop, this could mean that its customer base is largely made up of  New  Zealanders and adding more stuff that are peculiar to New Zealand to our product catalogue may boost revenue. 
2.	The three data analytics tools reflect the workshop’s top 5 customers  i.e, customers who have spent the most money in the workshop, we could send them mails to appreciate their patronage or give them voucher gift cards to encourage them to keep patronising us.
3.	16.37k was generated on 07/01/2017
4.	that the wholesale is the best performing channel while Exports is the least, this could be due to the fact that wholesalers buy in bulk or that a stronger relationship exists between the wholesalers and workshop staff/manager
5.	The total unit cost is portrayed by the tools
